# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Verilog

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), originally developed using MATLAB. The CNN model is designed to perform image classification tasks. This project includes the MATLAB code, the equivalent Verilog code, and instructions for synthesizing and simulating the Verilog code.


## Introduction

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Verilog. The CNN is first prototyped in MATLAB, and then each MATLAB function is converted into Verilog code. This approach allows us to leverage MATLAB's powerful numerical and visualization capabilities during development and ensure a seamless transition to hardware implementation.

## MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB code provided in this repository includes the following functionalities:
- Data preprocessing
- Convolutional layer
- Activation functions (e.g., ReLU)
- Pooling layer
- Fully connected layer
- Softmax layer
- Training and testing procedures

The MATLAB files included are:
- `convLayerDemo.m`
- `convolutionLayer.m`
- `fullyConnectedLayer.m`
- `fullyConnectedLDemo.m`
- `maxPoolingLayer.m`
- `maxPoolingLDemo.m`
- `padarray.m`
- `relu.m`
- `simpleVGG16.m`
- `vgg16_Demo.m`

## Verilog Implementation

The Verilog code mirrors the functionalities implemented in MATLAB. This part is under developing.
